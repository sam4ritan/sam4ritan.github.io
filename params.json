I do maintain some java/android-based projects and some simple webdesign (which i do not really like), but mostly i create scripts for stress-testing and similar tasks. The latter are not here, on GitHub, but on GitLab, because i do not want them to fall into the hands of some scriptkiddie, only to blow up in their face and fry their hardware.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, i tend to know my way around with Linux.\r\n\r\n###Why am I telling you this?\r\nCounterquestion: Why are you reading this?\r\n\r\nIf you want my help with a project, feel free to contact me over GitHub, GitLab or Twitter(@sam4ritan).\r\nIf you want one of my pen-testing scripts, contact me, but proove that you can handle them. Tell me exactly, what you want to do and show me you can understand how this stuff works.\r\n\r\nI will try to be a good samaritan, but i cannot guarantee it.\r\n\r\nIf you want a cookie, go to Ben's Cookies in Oxford, UK. They're the best ones out there and come at surprisingly low cost.",
