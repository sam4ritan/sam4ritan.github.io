<p>I am sam4ritan. </p>

<p>Obviously.</p>

<h3>
<a id="what-do-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-do-i-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do I do?</h3>

<p>Well, coding is what I do, from time to time, to say the least. More often than not it's scripts in python, ruby or for one of the many shells. Also, I do maintain some java/android-based projects and some simple webdesign (which I do not really like), but I mostly create scripts for stress-testing, automation and similar tasks. </p>

<p>The latter are not here on GitHub but on GitLab, because I do not want them to fall into the hands of some clueless scriptkiddie, only to blow up in their face and fry their hardware.</p>

<p>Additionally, I tend to know my way around with most operating sytems (including some rather esoteric stuff like Windows 8 or Emacs) but I usually prefer linux-based OS.</p>

<h3>
<a id="why-am-i-telling-you-this" class="anchor" href="#why-am-i-telling-you-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why am I telling you this?</h3>

<p>Counter-question: Why are you reading this?</p>

<p>If you want my help with a project, or got any other question regarding my person, feel free to contact me over GitHub, GitLab, Twitter or via IRC (<a href="https://webirc.hackint.org/#sam4ritan_cave">#sam4ritan_cave</a>). You can also write me an email, of course. The address can be found in any of the other three profiles that are linked here.</p>
<p></p>If you want one of my pen-testing scripts, contact me, but you've got to prove that you can handle them. Tell me, exactly, what you want to do and how you want to do it. Show me you can understand how this stuff works.</p>

<p>Basically, on this matter, try to prove you don't need my help, and you will receive it.</p>

<p>I will try to be a good samaritan, but I cannot guarantee it.</p>

<p>If you want a cookie, don't ask me. Go to Ben's Cookies in Oxford, UK. They've got the best out there and charge surprisingly little money for them.</p>
