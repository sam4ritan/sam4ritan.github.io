<p>I am sam4ritan. </p>

<p>Obviously.</p>

<a id="what-do-i-do" class="anchor" href="#what-do-i-do" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What do I do?</h3>

<p>I code from time to time. More often scripts than other stuff. I do maintain some java/android-based projects and some simple webdesign (which i do not really like), but mostly i create scripts for stress-testing and similar tasks. </p>

<p>The latter are not here, on GitHub, but on GitLab, because i do not want them to fall into the hands of some scriptkiddie, only to blow up in their face and fry their hardware.</p>

<p>Additionally, i tend to know my way around with Linux.</p>

<a id="why-am-i-telling-you-this" class="anchor" href="#why-am-i-telling-you-this" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why am I telling you this?</h3>

<p>Counterquestion: Why are you reading this?</p>

<p>If you want my help with a project, feel free to contact me over GitHub, GitLab or Twitter(<a href="https://twitter.com/sam4ritan">@sam4ritan</a>).
If you want one of my pen-testing scripts, contact me, but proove that you can handle them. Tell me, exactly, what you want to do and how you want to do it. Show me you can understand how this stuff works.</p>

<p>I will try to be a good samaritan, but i cannot guarantee it.</p>

<p>If you want a cookie, don't ask me. Go to Ben's Cookies in Oxford, UK. They've got the best out there and charge surprisingly little money for them.</p>
